# my-secure-chat
 A secure, end-to-end encrypted group chat built with Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and HTTPS. Messages are encrypted in the browser using a passphrase-derived AES key, so the server cannot read plaintext messages. Ideal for small groups of friends who need a simple, self-hosted, private chat solution.
